        <h1> About Us </h1>
        <h2> <em>Pick-me-up</em> : Your trusty cocktail of motivation </h2>
        <h4>By Camspiration: Henna Noor, Sakinah Merali, and Jai Rane</h4>
        <p> We are creating a motivational self-care page for Cambridge Students.
        We will be curating different forms of media (comfort food recipes, songs,
        inspirational quotes, recommended reads etc) to provide a one-stop hub for
        students seeking comfort after a rough day. Each TLC package will be
        personalized to address different situations every Cambridge student has experienced
        at least once for eg. 'My supervision went badly',
        'I feel like I don't belong here', 'I'm homesick' etc 

        We also want to add an option for site visitors to add their own quotes
        and media to the website so everything can ultimately by crowd-sourced.</p>
