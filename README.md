# <em> Pick-me-up Cambridge </em> by Camspiration
        Pick-me-up Cambridge is a motivational self-care page for Cambridge Students.
        We have curated all kinds of motivational media (comfort food recipes, songs,
        inspirational quotes, recommended reads, speeches, podcasts etc) to help you through a 
        rough day. Each of our TLC packages are personalized to address different anxieties every
        Cambridge student has and will experience at least once during their life from 
        'My supervision went badly' to 'I feel like I don't belong here' to 'I'm homesick' and more.

        We are also adding an option for site visitors to add their own quotes and media to our
        collection. ENJOY!
